 1. Find the percentage change in the KSE-100 index between opening and closing values.

SELECT 
    name AS index_name,
    ROUND(((closing_value - opening_value) / opening_value) * 100, 2) AS percent_change
FROM 
    stock_indices si
JOIN 
    index_movements im ON si.index_id = im.index_id
WHERE 
    si.name = 'KSE-100' AND movement_date = '2025-05-14';

2. List all analysts who commented on the event before 11:00 AM.

SELECT DISTINCT 
    a.name, 
    a.organization
FROM 
    analyst_comments ac
JOIN 
    analysts a ON ac.analyst_id = a.analyst_id
WHERE 
    ac.event_id = 1 AND ac.comment_time < '11:00:00';

3. Find a full event timeline: opening, high, low, and close for the day.

SELECT 
    si.name AS index_name,
    im.movement_date,
    im.opening_value,
    im.highest_value,
    im.lowest_value,
    im.closing_value
FROM 
    stock_indices si
JOIN 
    index_movements im ON si.index_id = im.index_id
WHERE 
    si.name = 'KSE-100' AND im.movement_date = '2025-05-14';


4. Calculate how much the index would have recovered if it had closed at the intraday high (112,457.37).

SELECT 
    113568.50 - 112457.37 AS opening_to_intraday_high,
    ROUND(((112457.37 - 113568.50) / 113568.50) * 100, 2) AS potential_recovery_percent

5.Identify events that caused more than 5% drop in PSX.


SELECT 
    me.event_name,
    im.intraday_drop_percent,
    me.event_date
FROM 
    market_events me
JOIN 
    event_impacts ei ON me.event_id = ei.event_id
JOIN 
    index_movements im ON ei.movement_id = im.movement_id
WHERE 
    im.intraday_drop_percent > 5 AND ei.index_id = 1;
